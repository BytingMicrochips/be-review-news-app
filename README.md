# Northcoders News API

Hello new developer - thank you for cloning!

 In order to locally connect to the two databases you will need to create your own .env files:

    Create two files, .env.development and .env.test 
 
    Inside the development file, write the line PGDATABASE=nc_news and PGDATABASE=nc_news_test inside the test file. 
 
 Then run npm install for any other dependencies and you will be up and running in no time!
